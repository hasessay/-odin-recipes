  <h1>Eggnog</h1>
    <img src="" alt="">
     <p>A traditional holiday drink dating back hundreds of years, eggnog is 
         made with <strong>eggs (hence the name), milk, cream, spices like nutmeg and 
         vanilla, </strong> and fortified with <strong> rum, whisky, and/or brandy</strong>.</p>
     <p>We grew up with eggnog, the kind you buy in a carton, and every Christmas 
         holiday we kids drank up as much of it as we could.</p>
     <p>I didn't even know that eggnog was a "spiked" drink until well into my adult years!</p>
     <P>Even now, I prefer my eggnog only lightly boozed, if at all. So this recipe is only 
         lightly spiked; feel free to increase the rum and bourbon to your heart's delight, or omit altogether if it's for the kids.</P>
