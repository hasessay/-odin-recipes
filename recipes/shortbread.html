    <h1>Shortbread Cookies</h1>

        pile of Shortbread Cookies and a cup of coffee in the background">

            <p>  Shortbread is a great cookie-jar cookie, in that it keeps well at room 
            temperature for several days. I live in the desert, so I keep them in a 
            container to prevent them from drying out—however, when I lived in Michigan 
            and Oregon, the humidity was the enemy. There, I found that storing cookies 
            in a lidded container with a silica gel packet (I just save these from other 
            food packages) keeps the humidity at bay </p>
            <P>These cookies also freeze well, and I freeze them in a freezer bag that I
             have pressed as much air out of as possible. They will keep for a month 
            or more, but honestly, we never have them around that long</P>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (256 g) all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 cup (115 g) powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, room temp and cut into pieces</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong> The oven and prepare the baking sheets:</strong> 
                        Preheat the oven to 325°F and line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Combine all the ingredients:</strong>
                        Place the flour, powdered sugar, salt, and butter into the bowl of a food processor.
                         Process for 30 seconds to 60 seconds. Stop when the mixture forms one mass the bowl. 
                         If it's not doing that, keep going in 10-second increments until it does. The dough 
                         is ready when the it clumps together when pressed.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Bring the dough together:</strong> 
                        Dump the dough onto the counter and gently 
                        press it together. Lightly knead the dough a few times and form it into a square shape. 
                        If it's still crumbly, keep kneading it with your hands until it makes a cohesive dough,
                         or pop it back in the food processor for a few more pulses.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Chill the dough:</strong> 
                        If the dough is quite soft, chill it in the refrigerator 
                        for 10 to 20 minutes, until it's cool but still pliable.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Roll and cut the dough:</strong> 
                        If the dough is quite soft, chill it in the refrigerator 
                        for 10 to 20 minutes,  until it's cool but still pliable.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Transfer and chill the cookies:</strong>
                        Transfer the cookies to one of the parchment-lined 
                        baking sheets. Chill the cookies on the sheet pan in the freezer for 15 minutes or until the cookies are solid to the touch.
                        Transfer the frozen cookies, in batches, onto the other baking sheets, leaving about 1/2 inch between each cookie.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Bake the cookies:</strong> 
                        Bake the cookies, one pan at a time, for 18 to 23 minutes, or until the cookies are dry to the touch and the bottoms just begin to turn golden.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Cool and store:</strong> 
                        Remove from the oven and cool on a rack before transferring to a container for storage. The baked and cooled cookies can be stored in an airtight container for several days.</li>
                </ol>
