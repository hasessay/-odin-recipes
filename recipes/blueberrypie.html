            <p>When blueberries are in season, what better to do with them (other than 
                eating them straight from the basket) than make blueberry pie?</p>
            <p>Blueberries have been found to be a "superfood", so good for you that you 
                should go out of your way to eat them. (As if we need a reason, right?)</p>
            <p>They neutralize free radicals, protect your heart, improve your vision,
                and protect against degenerative brain diseases. (See the whole story at <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=8">The World's Healthiest Foods website.)</a></p>
            <p>Blueberries come into season in early summer, but they freeze well, and you can easily make this pie with frozen berries.</p>
